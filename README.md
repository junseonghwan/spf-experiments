### Experiments for Streaming Particle Filter 

#### Phylogenetics

The experiments for phylogenetics can be found in the package `experiments.phylo`. The code for simulated data experiments can be found in:

+ `experiments.phylo.PhyloSPF.java` and
+ `experiments.phylo.PhyloSMC.java`.

The implementation of the prior-prior proposal is found in `experiments.phylo.PriorPriorProblemSpecification.java`.
